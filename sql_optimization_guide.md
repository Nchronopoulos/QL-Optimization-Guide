# SQL Optimization Guide 🚀

## 📌 Introduction
SQL optimization is crucial for improving database performance and reducing query execution time. This guide will cover indexing strategies, query performance tips, common mistakes, and real-world best practices to help you write **efficient SQL queries**.

## 1️⃣ Indexing & Schema Optimization

### 🔹 Understanding Indexes
Indexes help speed up data retrieval but can slow down write operations. Use them wisely.

#### ✅ Clustered vs Non-clustered Indexes
- **Clustered Index**: Sorts and stores data rows in order.
- **Non-clustered Index**: Separate structure storing pointers to data.

📌 **Best Practice:** Use **clustered indexes** for primary keys and **non-clustered indexes** for frequently queried columns.

#### ✅ Composite Indexes
- Combine multiple columns into one index to improve WHERE clause performance.
- Avoid unnecessary composite indexes as they increase storage overhead.

#### ✅ Avoiding Over-indexing
- **Too many indexes = slow writes & high storage costs**
- Monitor index usage with `pg_stat_user_indexes` (PostgreSQL) or `sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats` (SQL Server)

### 🔹 Schema Optimization
#### ✅ Normalize vs Denormalize
- **Normalization**: Reduces redundancy (e.g., breaking data into multiple tables)
- **Denormalization**: Improves read performance (e.g., storing redundant data for faster access)

📌 **Best Practice:** **Normalize for data integrity, denormalize for performance where necessary.**

#### ✅ Using Proper Data Types
- **Use INT instead of VARCHAR for IDs**
- **Use DATE instead of DATETIME if time isn't needed**

#### ✅ Partitioning Large Tables
- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Split large tables into smaller ones based on criteria (e.g., date ranges)
- **Vertical Partitioning**: Store frequently accessed columns separately

## 2️⃣ Query Performance Optimization

### 🔹 Using `EXPLAIN PLAN` & `ANALYZE`
SQL execution plans help understand how queries are executed.

#### ✅ Checking Query Performance
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01';
```
**Key Metrics:**
- **Seq Scan** (bad) → Means full table scan
- **Index Scan** (good) → Uses an index for retrieval

### 🔹 Joins & Subqueries Optimization
#### ✅ INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN Performance
```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.total 
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```
📌 **INNER JOIN is faster** than LEFT JOIN when NULL values aren't needed.

#### ✅ Avoiding Nested Subqueries
❌ **Inefficient Query:**
```sql
SELECT name FROM customers WHERE id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);
```
✅ **Optimized Query (Using JOIN):**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customers.name FROM customers INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

### 🔹 Pagination & LIMIT Optimization
- **Avoid OFFSET for large data sets**
- Use **Indexed Pagination** instead:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id > 500 LIMIT 50;
```

## 3️⃣ Common Mistakes & Fixes

#### ❌ Avoiding `SELECT *`
❌ **Bad Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```
✅ **Optimized Query:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, email FROM users;
```

#### ❌ Ensuring Index Usage
- Use `WHERE` on indexed columns
- Avoid `LIKE '%value%'` as it disables indexing
- Use **Covering Indexes** where possible

#### ❌ Reducing I/O Load
- Use **Batch Inserts** instead of single inserts
- Avoid large transactions locking rows
```sql
INSERT INTO orders (id, total) VALUES (1, 100), (2, 200), (3, 300);
```

## 4️⃣ Real-World SQL Performance Tuning

### 🔹 Case Study: Speeding Up a Slow Query
❌ **Slow Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01';
```
✅ **Optimized Query (Using Index):**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders(order_date);
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01';
```
📌 **Improvement:** Reduced execution time from **3 sec → 0.02 sec**

### 🔹 SQL Query Refactoring Example
- Convert **multiple OR conditions** into **UNION ALL**
- Replace **temporary tables** with **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

```sql
WITH latest_orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01'
)
SELECT * FROM latest_orders WHERE total > 100;
```
